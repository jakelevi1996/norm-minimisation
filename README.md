## TODO

- Implement stochastic optimisation module
- Create `Result` class for storing results from different experiments, including:
  - Attributes for storing the solution, time taken for different attempts, different norms of the solution/final values of the objective function, etc
  - Methods for saving, loading, and plotting these results, as well as printing them in tables
