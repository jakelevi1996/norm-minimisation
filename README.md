## TODO

- Implement stochastic optimisation module
- Create `Result` class for storing results from different experiments, including:
  - Attributes for storing the solution, time taken for different attempts, different norms of the solution/final values of the objective function, etc
  - Methods for saving, loading, and plotting these results, as well as printing them in tables
- Rename repository `linear_optimisation`
- Update `find_x_vals` and `find_t_vals` to accept list of problem names to pass to `save_vals_list`
- Incorporate problem-names into `Result` class
- Get `problem_lists` working consistently across all functions
